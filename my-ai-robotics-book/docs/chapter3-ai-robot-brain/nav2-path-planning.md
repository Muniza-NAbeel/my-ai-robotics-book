# Nav2 Path Planning: Autonomous Robot Navigation

Nav2 is the ROS 2 navigation stack, providing a robust and flexible framework for autonomous mobile robots to navigate complex environments. It offers a suite of modular components that can be configured to enable capabilities such as mapping, localization, path planning, and obstacle avoidance.

## Nav2 Stack Overview

Nav2 follows a behavior tree-based architecture, allowing for sophisticated navigation behaviors to be composed from simpler actions. Key components include:

-   **Behavior Tree**: Orchestrates navigation tasks, such as `DriveOnPath`, `NavigateThroughPoses`, or `FollowWaypoints`.
-   **Waypoint Follower**: Enables the robot to move sequentially through a list of predefined waypoints.
-   **Costmap**: A 2D or 3D grid representing the robot's environment, indicating obstacles and free space. Used for path planning and local obstacle avoidance.
-   **Global Planner**: Plans a collision-free path from the robot's current location to a goal location, typically using algorithms like A* or Dijkstra.
-   **Local Planner**: Generates short-term velocity commands to follow the global path and avoid dynamic obstacles in the immediate vicinity.
-   **Controller**: Executes the velocity commands generated by the local planner.
-   **AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization)**: A probabilistic localization algorithm that estimates the robot's pose within a known map using sensor data.
-   **SLAM Toolbox (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Used to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously localizing the robot within that map.

## Path Planning Process

1.  **Map Creation/Loading**: The robot either builds a map using SLAM or loads a pre-existing map.
2.  **Localization**: The robot estimates its position within the map (e.g., using AMCL and LiDAR data).
3.  **Goal Setting**: A navigation goal (pose) is provided to the Nav2 stack.
4.  **Global Path Planning**: The global planner computes a path from the robot's current position to the goal.
5.  **Local Path Following and Obstacle Avoidance**: The local planner and controller generate and execute velocity commands to follow the global path, dynamically avoiding obstacles detected by sensors.
6.  **Path Execution**: The robot moves along the planned path until the goal is reached or an error occurs.

### Example: Nav2 Goal Pose (Python with `rclpy`)

You can send navigation goals to Nav2 using a ROS 2 action client. Here's a simplified Python example:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.action import ActionClient
from rclpy.node import Node
from nav2_msgs.action import NavigateToPose
from geometry_msgs.msg import PoseStamped

class Navigator(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('simple_navigator')
        self.action_client = ActionClient(self, NavigateToPose, 'navigate_to_pose')

    def send_goal(self, x, y, yaw):
        goal_msg = NavigateToPose.Goal()
        goal_msg.pose.header.frame_id = 'map'
        goal_msg.pose.pose.position.x = x
        goal_msg.pose.pose.position.y = y
        # Convert yaw to quaternion
        from tf_transformations import quaternion_from_euler
        q = quaternion_from_euler(0, 0, yaw)
        goal_msg.pose.pose.orientation.x = q[0]
        goal_msg.pose.pose.orientation.y = q[1]
        goal_msg.pose.pose.orientation.z = q[2]
        goal_msg.pose.pose.orientation.w = q[3]

        self.get_logger().info(f'Waiting for action server: {self.action_client.wait_for_server(timeout_sec=10.0)}')
        if not self.action_client.wait_for_server(timeout_sec=10.0):
            self.get_logger().error('Action server not available!')
            return

        self.get_logger().info('Sending goal...')
        self.send_goal_future = self.action_client.send_goal_async(goal_msg)
        self.send_goal_future.add_done_callback(self.goal_response_callback)

    def goal_response_callback(self, future):
        goal_handle = future.result()
        if not goal_handle.accepted:
            self.get_logger().info('Goal rejected :(')
            return

        self.get_logger().info('Goal accepted :)')
        self.get_result_future = goal_handle.get_result_async()
        self.get_result_future.add_done_callback(self.get_result_callback)

    def get_result_callback(self, future):
        result = future.result().result
        self.get_logger().info(f'Goal reached: {result.succeeded}')
        rclpy.shutdown()

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    navigator = Navigator()
    navigator.send_goal(x=5.0, y=-2.0, yaw=0.0) # Example: Go to (5.0, -2.0) with 0 yaw
    rclpy.spin(navigator)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code demonstrates how to send a `NavigateToPose` goal to the Nav2 stack, enabling your robot to move autonomously to a specified target. Mastering Nav2 allows for sophisticated autonomous navigation capabilities in your robotic systems.
