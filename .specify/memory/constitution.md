# Academic textbook using Docusaurus Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through primary-source verification
All factual claims must include citations from primary sources.

### Clarity for an academic audience (computer science/engineering students)
Writing level: Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10–12. Tone: academic, precise, neutral. Explanations must be clear and unambiguous. Include definitions when introducing technical terms.

### Reproducibility
All claims must be traceable to their original sources. Citation style: APA.

### Rigor
Peer-reviewed and scholarly sources preferred. Minimum 15 sources, with 50% peer-reviewed. Acceptable sources: Peer-reviewed journals, Academic books, University publications, Conference papers, Reputable robotics/AI research.

### Zero plagiarism tolerance
Plagiarism check must ensure 0% similarity. Agent should self-audit for broken citations, unsupported claims, missing references, incorrect formatting.

## Text Quality Requirements

Writing level: Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10–12
Tone: academic, precise, neutral
Explanations must be clear and unambiguous
Include definitions when introducing technical terms

## Output Format & Content Requirements

Structured Markdown compatible with Docusaurus
PDF version with embedded APA citations
Total word count: 5,000–7,000 words
Internal structure: Title Page, Preface, Chapter organization, Summary sections, References section (APA format)
Project will cover: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics (topic placeholder – final topic may change later)
Produced through h labs
Deployed on GitHub Pages
Avoid: Blogs without citations, Non-expert opinions, AI-generated claims without sources

## Governance

All claims must be verified before inclusion.
Must pass a final fact-checking review.
Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan.
All PRs/reviews must verify compliance.
Complexity must be justified.
